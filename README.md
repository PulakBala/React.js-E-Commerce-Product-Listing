# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Product List Application

Overview
This is a Product List Application built with React. It allows users to view products in either grid or list view, filter products based on various criteria, and sort them. The application also includes a theme toggle to switch between light and dark modes.

Features
Grid and List View: Toggle between grid and list views for displaying products.
Filtering: Filter products based on category, price range, and stock availability.
Sorting: Sort products by price or name in ascending or descending order.
Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark themes.
Description Expansion: Expand or collapse product descriptions for better readability.


Assumptions
API Endpoint: The fetchProducts function fetches product data from an external API. Ensure that this endpoint is correctly set up and accessible.
Product Data: The product data returned from the API includes fields such as id, image, title, price, description, category, priceRange, and rating.
Environment: The application is assumed to be running in a modern browser environment that supports React and Tailwind CSS.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure Node.js (version 14.x or later) is installed on your machine.
npm or Yarn: Ensure npm or Yarn is installed for managing dependencies.

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-list-app.git
cd product-list-app
Install Dependencies

Use npm or Yarn to install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
npm install
or

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Set Up Environment Variables

If your project requires environment variables (e.g., API keys), create a .env file in the root directory and add the necessary variables. For example:

env
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com/products
Run the Development Server

Start the development server to run the application locally.

bash
Copy code
npm start
or

bash
Copy code
yarn start
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified).

Build for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
or

bash
Copy code
yarn build
This will generate a build directory with optimized production files.

Additional Features
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and should work well on both mobile and desktop devices.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is included for failed API requests.
Loading State: Displays a loading message while product data is being fetched.
